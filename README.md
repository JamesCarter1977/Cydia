Let iOS apps talk

A user contributable directory of iOS apps with x-callback-urls.

## Motivation

While tinkering with the amazing [Workflow app](http://workflow.is) I discovered [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com), a way to let apps to talk to each other through URLs with standardized callback parameters. This looked amazing.

I then wanted to find out which apps already supported this and found that the current app directories are outdated / not exhaustive. As it quite often happens documentation is not always up-to-date.

So I wanted to fix this. And the only way to have a chance to stay up-to-date is to crowd source the documentation. So this repository allows for exactly that.

## Contribute

Read about how to [contribute to this project](https://github.com/pietropizzi/app-talk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Future plans

I started a GitHub [project in this repo to track the ideas / plans](https://github.com/pietropizzi/app-talk/projects/1) I have.

The main points for now:

* Allow rich text (probably Markdown) in the description of the actions
* Add search field to filter apps
